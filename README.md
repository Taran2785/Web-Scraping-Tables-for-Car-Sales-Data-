**US Vehicle Sales Last Month**

We compare U.S market SUV sales for last month with the same month last year. We also include the year to date sales numbers and compare with the same year to date numbers from last year. With both monthly and YTD sales numbers we have a growth rate column so you can better gauge an individual SUV sales success in the U.S market.


**US Quarterly Vehicle Model Sales Number**

This data table looks at quarterly sales performance for the every model sold in the United States. It includes all major models sold in the U.S market. We compare last quarter’s passenger car U.S sales at the model level with the same model’s sales quarter last year. We also include a growth rate too so you can see which models are growing and which ones are declining. The quarterly view of sales at the model level often gives you a better picture of what is happening than monthly because it takes out some of the month to month noise.
